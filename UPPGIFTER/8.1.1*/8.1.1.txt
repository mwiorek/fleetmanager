Check wether or not $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'] and $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW'] are set
to we assign these variables or empty string depending on if set.

Check the username and password against an array('username' => 'password'),
if username and password match return true else false

if the users credentials are ok, the server will send the user on to the page to
display the welcome message

if the user is not yet authenticated the server will send a http response code 401: not authorized it will then send an authenticate 'basic' header. When the user enters his/ 
hers username and password the browser will base64 encode the string as such: "username:password" and pass it on to the server. This method is not a safe method. As 
passwords are being sent in only more or less plain text as close as to the base64 en-
oding.
